# HMC Makerspace Github Organization
The Harvey Mudd Makerspace is a student-run facility for providing access to tools, resources, space, and storage to work on a variety of projects.

This organization serves as a centralized profile for all software developed for the Makerspace. Currently under development:

- MAKE:  Unified managment application for HMC's Makerspace. Provides the user-facing site https://make.hmc.edu as well as several internal tools for tool checkout, inventory management, and more.
- BLUEPRINT: Large format printing utility that makes printing on the EPSON P8000 more streamlined.

Current webmaster: Ethan Vazquez <evazquez@g.hmc.edu>
